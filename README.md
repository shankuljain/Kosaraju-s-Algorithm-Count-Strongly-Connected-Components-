# Kosaraju-s-Algorithm-Count-Strongly-Connected-Components-
An algorithm to count strongly connected components in a directed graph.

This program counts no of strongly connected components in a directed graph. It uses Kosaraju's Algorithm to count the SCCs.
There are two subroutines of DFS to count the no. In first DFS an order is computed for second DFS.
